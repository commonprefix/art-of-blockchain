# Queues

Message queues are a fundamental building block of modern distributed systems, and they're particularly critical in blockchain infrastructure where different components often need to operate at varying speeds and scales.

Take a node example pseudocode here and see why without message queues slower components would bottleneck faster ones.

```python
async def process_new_block(block):
    await validate_block(block) # Fast
    await update_state(block) # Slow
    await index_transactions(block) # Very slow
    await notify_subscribers(block) # Network I/O - unpredictable
```

Without queues, this sequential processing creates bottlenecks:

* Fast validation (100ms) must wait for slow indexing (10s)
* Network failures in notification can block the entire pipeline

Thatâ€™s why message queues is a mandatory building tool in the blockchain space. By employing queues we achieve parallel processing of different operations, independent scaling of workers basic on the load of a specific operation as well as the ability to isolate faults between components.

Even though there are a lot of queue implementations out there knowing how rabbitMQ works is sufficient to get familiar with the queueing logic.

In order to familiarize yourself with queues we suggest the following material:

* Learn the basics of queues and set up your own rabbitMQ by following [Part 1](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part1-rabbitmq-for-beginners-what-is-rabbitmq.html) and [Part 2](https://www.cloudamqp.com/blog/part2-2-rabbitmq-for-beginners_example-and-sample-code-node-js.html) of CloudAMQP
* Dive deeper on different queue protocols and policing by reading [this](https://kisztof.medium.com/rabbitmq-an-introduction-to-message-queuing-protocols-and-policies-cb6073c7a3d6) article.

## Optional&#x20;

As mentioned, message queues are a critical component in distributed systems design. For theoretical foundations, start with Martin Kleppmann's "[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://archive.org/details/designing-data-intensive-applications-th/page/137/mode/1up?q=Message+Passing)," focusing on the chapters covering message passing and stream processing. For hands-on experience, build a simple message queue using [RabbitMQ's official tutorials](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials).&#x20;

To understand real-world implementations and see a RabbitMQ alternative, you can also examine [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)'s architecture documentation and its [application in high-scale systems](https://kafka.apache.org/uses).
