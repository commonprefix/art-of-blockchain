Fortunately, software is not a one-man job. But even if it were, version control is unavoidable.

Version control mastery is particularly vital for blockchain engineers, given the open-source nature of most blockchain projects.

This open development model requires engineers to thoroughly understand version control workflows, from managing pull requests and handling merge conflicts to participating in code reviews and tracking issues.

Becoming proficient with Git is a simple process, but becoming a Git expert requires years of experience. Our recommendations are:&#x20;

> 💡 **Info**
> *   Read [Git from the Bottom](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/) Up
> * Play through the entire [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) game&#x20;

## Optional

As mentioned above, Git on an advanced level has many concepts that can become hard to grasp. Even though it's lengthy, you can read the whole [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) to understand all of its features.&#x20;

In addition, [learning some history](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/git-origin-story) behind the arguably most widely used piece of software out there shouldn't be a waste of time.
