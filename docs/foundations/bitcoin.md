# Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the original blockchain. It was proposed in 2008 by a pseudonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto and deployed in early 2009 as an open-source software project. Bitcoin introduced the first practical implementation of a decentralized timestamping mechanism using proof-of-work and a consensus-driven ledger. The systemâ€™s design was a direct reaction to centralized failure points and it sparked an entirely new field of programmable, distributed systems.

Unlike account-based models used in platforms like Ethereum, Bitcoin operates on the **[UTXO](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utxo.asp) (Unspent Transaction Output)** model. Each transaction consumes one or more previous outputs and creates new ones, forming a directed acyclic graph of spendable outputs. This model enables a high degree of statelessness and p  arallelism in transaction validation, and it naturally supports features like privacy-preserving mechanisms.

Bitcoin scripting is intentionally minimal. It uses a stack-based language called **Script**, which supports primitives like time locks (`OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY`), hashlocks (`OP_HASH160`, `OP_EQUALVERIFY`), and multi-signature authorization (`OP_CHECKMULTISIG`). These building blocks can be composed into complex contract logic such as payment channels, escrows and other structures.

Key upgrades in Bitcoinâ€™s history include:

- **[BIP16](https://river.com/learn/terms/b/bip-16-p2sh/) (P2SH)**: Introduced Pay-to-Script-Hash to hide complex scripts behind a hash.
- **[SegWit](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/guide/segwit/) (BIP141)**: Fixed transaction malleability and laid the groundwork for scaling via second-layer protocols.
- **[Taproot](https://www.dydx.xyz/crypto-learning/what-is-taproot#:~:text=Taproot%20was%20a%202021%20update,Maxwell's%20contributions%20in%20succeeding%20years.) (BIP341)**: Enabled more private and composable smart contracts using Schnorr signatures and Merkleized script trees.

Consensus changes are rare and conservative, since tens of millions of users are affected by them. Most upgrades are implemented via [soft forks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/soft-fork.asp), requiring careful coordination among miners, nodes, and developers. For the latter, Bitcoin presents a unique and intellectually rigorous environment: its ecosystem demands minimalism, careful design, and a strong grasp of cryptographic and distributed systems principles.
